        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>eri</code> package is published on npm so you can install it
          with your favorite package manager. Tree-shaking and TypeScript are
          supported out the box!
        </p>
        <p>
          To get the styles working you will need to include the CSS in your app
          which can be found at <code>eri/dist/index.css</code> in your{' '}
          <code>node_modules</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get the font working you should include the following tag in your
          HTML page:{' '}
          <code>
            {
              '<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:400,900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">'
            }
          </code>
