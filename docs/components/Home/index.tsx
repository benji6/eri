        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>eri</code> package is published on npm so you can install it
          with your favorite package manager. Tree-shaking and TypeScript are
          supported out the box!
        </p>
        <p>
          To get the styles working you will need to include the CSS in your app
          which can be found at <code>eri/dist/index.css</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get the font working you should include the following tags in your
          HTML page:
          <br />
          <code>
            {`<link href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" rel="preconnect" crossorigin="anonymous">
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Public+Sans:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">`}
          </code>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Eri is a design system that I created for my personal projects, but it
          is free and open source and the{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/benji6/eri">
            code is available on GitHub
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Documentation is a little sparse because I&apos;m the only person who
          uses this, but it should be fairly straightforward to use, especially
          if you&apos;re using TypeScript.
